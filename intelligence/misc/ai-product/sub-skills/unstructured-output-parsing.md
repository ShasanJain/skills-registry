description: Use when executing unstructured output parsing protocols within the intelligence sector.

## 🛠️ Implementation SOP
Follow this step-by-step TDD procedure to execute the protocol:

- **Step 1: Baseline Context**: Verify the operational environment. Ensure required tools (like Python, Node, TS, or native CLI) are accessible before injecting new logic.
- **Step 2: Apply the Pattern**: Implement the core unstructured output parsing logic directly into the active system context.
- **Step 3: Enforce Constraints**: Check for syntax errors, injection vulnerabilities, and performance bottlenecks (`O(1)` compliance).
- **Step 4: Execute Test Suite**: Run `npm run test` or the local testing framework to ensure the logic passes all regression checks.
- **Step 5: Document and Commit**: Update the session walkthrough and sync the telemetry logs for the intelligence sector.

# ❌ Unstructured output parsing

**Why bad**: Breaks randomly. Inconsistent formats. Injection risks.

## ⚠️ Sharp Edges

| Issue | Severity | Solution |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Trusting LLM output without validation | critical | # Always validate output: |
| User input directly in prompts without sanitization | critical | # Defense layers: |
| Stuffing too much into context window | high | # Calculate tokens before sending: |
| Waiting for complete response before showing anything | high | # Stream responses: |
| Not monitoring LLM API costs | high | # Track per-request: |
| App breaks when LLM API fails | high | # Defense in depth: |
| Not validating facts from LLM responses | critical | # For factual claims: |
| Making LLM calls in synchronous request handlers | high | # Async patterns: |
