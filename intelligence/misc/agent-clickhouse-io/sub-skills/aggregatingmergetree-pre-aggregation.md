# Aggregatingmergetree Pre Aggregation: Execution Protocol

## ⚙️ Overview
This protocol defines the exact standards for implementing Aggregatingmergetree Pre Aggregation. By following this strict operational pattern, the engine guarantees deterministic execution, high performance, and complete adherence to all architectural guardrails established by the system design.

## 🛠️ Implementation SOP
Follow this step-by-step TDD procedure to execute the protocol:

- **Step 1: Baseline Context**: Verify the operational environment. Ensure required tools (like Python, Node, TS, or native CLI) are accessible before injecting new logic.
- **Step 2: Apply the Pattern**: Implement the core aggregatingmergetree pre aggregation logic directly into the active system context.
- **Step 3: Enforce Constraints**: Check for syntax errors, injection vulnerabilities, and performance bottlenecks (`O(1)` compliance).
- **Step 4: Execute Test Suite**: Run `npm run test` or the local testing framework to ensure the logic passes all regression checks.
- **Step 5: Document and Commit**: Update the session walkthrough and sync the telemetry logs for the intelligence sector.

# AggregatingMergeTree (Pre-aggregation)

```sql
-- For maintaining aggregated metrics
CREATE TABLE market_stats_hourly (
    hour DateTime,
    market_id String,
    total_volume AggregateFunction(sum, UInt64),
    total_trades AggregateFunction(count, UInt32),
    unique_users AggregateFunction(uniq, String)
) ENGINE = AggregatingMergeTree()
PARTITION BY toYYYYMM(hour)
ORDER BY (hour, market_id);

-- Query aggregated data
SELECT
    hour,
    market_id,
    sumMerge(total_volume) AS volume,
    countMerge(total_trades) AS trades,
    uniqMerge(unique_users) AS users
FROM market_stats_hourly
WHERE hour >= toStartOfHour(now() - INTERVAL 24 HOUR)
GROUP BY hour, market_id
ORDER BY hour DESC;
```
