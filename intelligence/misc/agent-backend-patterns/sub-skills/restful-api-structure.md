# Restful Api Structure: Execution Protocol

## ⚙️ Overview
This protocol defines the exact standards for implementing Restful Api Structure. By following this strict operational pattern, the engine guarantees deterministic execution, high performance, and complete adherence to all architectural guardrails established by the system design.

## 🛠️ Implementation SOP
Follow this step-by-step TDD procedure to execute the protocol:

- **Step 1: Baseline Context**: Verify the operational environment. Ensure required tools (like Python, Node, TS, or native CLI) are accessible before injecting new logic.
- **Step 2: Apply the Pattern**: Implement the core restful api structure logic directly into the active system context.
- **Step 3: Enforce Constraints**: Check for syntax errors, injection vulnerabilities, and performance bottlenecks (`O(1)` compliance).
- **Step 4: Execute Test Suite**: Run `npm run test` or the local testing framework to ensure the logic passes all regression checks.
- **Step 5: Document and Commit**: Update the session walkthrough and sync the telemetry logs for the intelligence sector.

## 📚 Reference Material

# RESTful API Structure

```typescript
// ✅ Resource-based URLs
GET    /api/markets                 # List resources
GET    /api/markets/:id             # Get single resource
POST   /api/markets                 # Create resource
PUT    /api/markets/:id             # Replace resource
PATCH  /api/markets/:id             # Update resource
DELETE /api/markets/:id             # Delete resource

// ✅ Query parameters for filtering, sorting, pagination
GET /api/markets?status=active&sort=volume&limit=20&offset=0
```
