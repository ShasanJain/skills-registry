# Internal Comms: Standard Operating Procedure

## ⚙️ Overview
This protocol defines the strict standard for implementing Internal Comms. By following this SOP, the engine ensures token efficiency, maximum architectural stability, robust caching, and adherence to all operational guardrails established by the system architecture.

# 📊 Internal Communications & Status Reporting
> **SOP Version**: 5.0.0-Industrial
> **Goal**: High-clarity updates for leadership and stakeholders.

## 🚫 THE ANTI-SLOP CONSTITUTION
- **BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)**: The first sentence MUST summarize the exact point. No warm-ups.
- **Zero Jargon**: BAN "synergy", "circle back", "align", "deep dive". Keep it terse.
- **Action-Oriented**: Every message must end with explicit Next Steps (Who/What/When).

## 📈 1. 3P Updates (Progress, Plans, Problems)
Use this for weekly/bi-weekly team updates.
- **Progress**: What was *actually* completed? (Use quantifiable metrics).
- **Plans**: What are the top 3 priorities for the next cycle?
- **Problems**: What is blocking progress? (Define "Need" vs. "FYI").

## 📋 2. Leadership Status Reports
- **Executive Summary**: One paragraph. Top-line impact only.
- **Milestone Tracker**: Simple table: [Milestone] | [Status] | [ETA].
- **Risk Assessment**: High/Medium/Low markers for any potential delays.

## ❓ 3. FAQ & Community Comms
- **Inverted Pyramid**: Put the most important information in the first sentence.
- **Tone**: Professional, transparent, and authoritative.
- **Call to Action**: Always provide a clear next step or contact point.

## ⚡ 4. Incident Reports (Post-Mortems)
- **Timeline**: Exact sequence of events.
- **Root Cause**: Why did it break? (5 Whys method).
- **Remediation**: Steps taken to ensure it never happens again.
