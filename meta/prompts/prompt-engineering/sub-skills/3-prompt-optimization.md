# 3 Prompt Optimization: Operational Execution SOP

## ⚙️ Overview
This protocol defines the strict standard for implementing 3 Prompt Optimization. By following this SOP, the engine ensures token efficiency, maximum architectural stability, and robust caching.

## 🛠️ Implementation SOP
Follow this step-by-step TDD procedure to execute the pattern:

- **Step 1: Baseline Context**: Verify the operational environment. Ensure required tools (like TS, ESLint, or native CLI) are accessible before injecting new logic.
- **Step 2: Apply the Pattern**: Implement the core 3 prompt optimization logic into the active code or prompt block.
- **Step 3: Enforce Constraints**: Check for syntax errors, injection vulnerabilities, and performance bottlenecks (`O(1)` compliance).
- **Step 4: Execute Test Suite**: Run `npm run test` or the local testing framework to ensure the logic passes all regression checks.
- **Step 5: Document and Commit**: Update the session walkthrough and sync the telemetry logs.

# 3. Prompt Optimization

Systematically improve prompts through testing and refinement. Start simple, measure performance (accuracy, consistency, token usage), then iterate. Test on diverse inputs including edge cases. Use A/B testing to compare variations. Critical for production prompts where consistency and cost matter.

**Example:**

```markdown
Version 1 (Simple): "Summarize this article"
→ Result: Inconsistent length, misses key points

Version 2 (Add constraints): "Summarize in 3 bullet points"
→ Result: Better structure, but still misses nuance

Version 3 (Add reasoning): "Identify the 3 main findings, then summarize each"
→ Result: Consistent, accurate, captures key information
```
