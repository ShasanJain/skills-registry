# 2 Basic Host Reconnaissance: Execution Protocol

## ⚙️ Overview
This protocol defines the exact standards for implementing 2 Basic Host Reconnaissance. By following this strict operational pattern, the engine guarantees deterministic execution, high performance, and complete adherence to all architectural guardrails established by the system design.

## 🛠️ Implementation SOP
Follow this step-by-step TDD procedure to execute the protocol:

- **Step 1: Baseline Context**: Verify the operational environment. Ensure required tools (like Python, Node, TS, or native CLI) are accessible before injecting new logic.
- **Step 2: Apply the Pattern**: Implement the core 2 basic host reconnaissance logic directly into the active system context.
- **Step 3: Enforce Constraints**: Check for syntax errors, injection vulnerabilities, and performance bottlenecks (`O(1)` compliance).
- **Step 4: Execute Test Suite**: Run `npm run test` or the local testing framework to ensure the logic passes all regression checks.
- **Step 5: Document and Commit**: Update the session walkthrough and sync the telemetry logs for the security sector.

## 📚 Reference Material

# 2. Basic Host Reconnaissance

#### Query Single Host
```bash
# Get all information about an IP
shodan host 1.1.1.1

# Example output:
# 1.1.1.1
# Hostnames: one.one.one.one
# Country: Australia
# Organization: Mountain View Communications
# Number of open ports: 3
# Ports:
#   53/udp
#   80/tcp
#   443/tcp
```

#### Check if Host is Honeypot
```bash
# Get honeypot probability score
shodan honeyscore 192.168.1.100

# Output: Not a honeypot
#         Score: 0.3
```
