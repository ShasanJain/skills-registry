# Step 1 Kerberos Clock Sync: Execution Protocol

## ⚙️ Overview
This protocol defines the exact standards for implementing Step 1 Kerberos Clock Sync. By following this strict operational pattern, the engine guarantees deterministic execution, high performance, and complete adherence to all architectural guardrails established by the system design.

## 🛠️ Implementation SOP
Follow this step-by-step TDD procedure to execute the protocol:

- **Step 1: Baseline Context**: Verify the operational environment. Ensure required tools (like Python, Node, TS, or native CLI) are accessible before injecting new logic.
- **Step 2: Apply the Pattern**: Implement the core step 1 kerberos clock sync logic directly into the active system context.
- **Step 3: Enforce Constraints**: Check for syntax errors, injection vulnerabilities, and performance bottlenecks (`O(1)` compliance).
- **Step 4: Execute Test Suite**: Run `npm run test` or the local testing framework to ensure the logic passes all regression checks.
- **Step 5: Document and Commit**: Update the session walkthrough and sync the telemetry logs for the security sector.

# Step 1: Kerberos Clock Sync

Kerberos requires clock synchronization (±5 minutes):

```bash
# Detect clock skew
nmap -sT 10.10.10.10 -p445 --script smb2-time

# Fix clock on Linux
sudo date -s "14 APR 2024 18:25:16"

# Fix clock on Windows
net time /domain /set

# Fake clock without changing system time
faketime -f '+8h' <command>
```
