# Choosing The Right Memory Type: Execution Protocol

## ⚙️ Overview
This protocol defines the exact standards for implementing Choosing The Right Memory Type. By following this strict operational pattern, the engine guarantees deterministic execution, high performance, and complete adherence to all architectural guardrails established by the system design.

## 🛠️ Implementation SOP
Follow this step-by-step TDD procedure to execute the protocol:

- **Step 1: Baseline Context**: Verify the operational environment. Ensure required tools (like Python, Node, TS, or native CLI) are accessible before injecting new logic.
- **Step 2: Apply the Pattern**: Implement the core choosing the right memory type logic directly into the active system context.
- **Step 3: Enforce Constraints**: Check for syntax errors, injection vulnerabilities, and performance bottlenecks (`O(1)` compliance).
- **Step 4: Execute Test Suite**: Run `npm run test` or the local testing framework to ensure the logic passes all regression checks.
- **Step 5: Document and Commit**: Update the session walkthrough and sync the telemetry logs for the engineering sector.

# Choosing the Right Memory Type

```python
# For short conversations (< 10 messages)
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory
memory = ConversationBufferMemory()

# For long conversations (summarize old messages)
from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryMemory
memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(llm=llm)

# For sliding window (last N messages)
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferWindowMemory
memory = ConversationBufferWindowMemory(k=5)

# For entity tracking
from langchain.memory import ConversationEntityMemory
memory = ConversationEntityMemory(llm=llm)

# For semantic retrieval of relevant history
from langchain.memory import VectorStoreRetrieverMemory
memory = VectorStoreRetrieverMemory(retriever=retriever)
```
