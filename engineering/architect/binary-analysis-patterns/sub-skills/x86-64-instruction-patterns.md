# X86 64 Instruction Patterns: Execution Protocol

## ⚙️ Overview
This protocol defines the exact standards for implementing X86 64 Instruction Patterns. By following this strict operational pattern, the engine guarantees deterministic execution, high performance, and complete adherence to all architectural guardrails established by the system design.

## 🛠️ Implementation SOP
Follow this step-by-step TDD procedure to execute the protocol:

- **Step 1: Baseline Context**: Verify the operational environment. Ensure required tools (like Python, Node, TS, or native CLI) are accessible before injecting new logic.
- **Step 2: Apply the Pattern**: Implement the core x86 64 instruction patterns logic directly into the active system context.
- **Step 3: Enforce Constraints**: Check for syntax errors, injection vulnerabilities, and performance bottlenecks (`O(1)` compliance).
- **Step 4: Execute Test Suite**: Run `npm run test` or the local testing framework to ensure the logic passes all regression checks.
- **Step 5: Document and Commit**: Update the session walkthrough and sync the telemetry logs for the engineering sector.

## 📚 Reference Material

# x86-64 Instruction Patterns

#### Function Prologue/Epilogue
```asm
; Standard prologue
push rbp           ; Save base pointer
mov rbp, rsp       ; Set up stack frame
sub rsp, 0x20      ; Allocate local variables

; Leaf function (no calls)
; May skip frame pointer setup
sub rsp, 0x18      ; Just allocate locals

; Standard epilogue
mov rsp, rbp       ; Restore stack pointer
pop rbp            ; Restore base pointer
ret

; Leave instruction (equivalent)
leave              ; mov rsp, rbp; pop rbp
ret
```

#### Calling Conventions

**System V AMD64 (Linux, macOS)**
```asm
; Arguments: RDI, RSI, RDX, RCX, R8, R9, then stack
; Return: RAX (and RDX for 128-bit)
; Caller-saved: RAX, RCX, RDX, RSI, RDI, R8-R11
; Callee-saved: RBX, RBP, R12-R15

; Example: func(a, b, c, d, e, f, g)
mov rdi, [a]       ; 1st arg
mov rsi, [b]       ; 2nd arg
mov rdx, [c]       ; 3rd arg
mov rcx, [d]       ; 4th arg
mov r8, [e]        ; 5th arg
mov r9, [f]        ; 6th arg
push [g]           ; 7th arg on stack
call func
```

**Microsoft x64 (Windows)**
```asm
; Arguments: RCX, RDX, R8, R9, then stack
; Shadow space: 32 bytes reserved on stack
; Return: RAX

; Example: func(a, b, c, d, e)
sub rsp, 0x28      ; Shadow space + alignment
mov rcx, [a]       ; 1st arg
mov rdx, [b]       ; 2nd arg
mov r8, [c]        ; 3rd arg
mov r9, [d]        ; 4th arg
mov [rsp+0x20], [e] ; 5th arg on stack
call func
add rsp, 0x28
```
