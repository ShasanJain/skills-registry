# Type Recovery: Execution Protocol

## ⚙️ Overview
This protocol defines the exact standards for implementing Type Recovery. By following this strict operational pattern, the engine guarantees deterministic execution, high performance, and complete adherence to all architectural guardrails established by the system design.

## 🛠️ Implementation SOP
Follow this step-by-step TDD procedure to execute the protocol:

- **Step 1: Baseline Context**: Verify the operational environment. Ensure required tools (like Python, Node, TS, or native CLI) are accessible before injecting new logic.
- **Step 2: Apply the Pattern**: Implement the core type recovery logic directly into the active system context.
- **Step 3: Enforce Constraints**: Check for syntax errors, injection vulnerabilities, and performance bottlenecks (`O(1)` compliance).
- **Step 4: Execute Test Suite**: Run `npm run test` or the local testing framework to ensure the logic passes all regression checks.
- **Step 5: Document and Commit**: Update the session walkthrough and sync the telemetry logs for the engineering sector.

# Type Recovery

```asm
; 1-byte operations suggest char/bool
movzx eax, byte [rdi]   ; Zero-extend byte
movsx eax, byte [rdi]   ; Sign-extend byte

; 2-byte operations suggest short
movzx eax, word [rdi]
movsx eax, word [rdi]

; 4-byte operations suggest int/float
mov eax, [rdi]
movss xmm0, [rdi]       ; Float

; 8-byte operations suggest long/double/pointer
mov rax, [rdi]
movsd xmm0, [rdi]       ; Double
```
