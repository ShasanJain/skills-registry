# When To Use Async: Execution Protocol

## ⚙️ Overview
This protocol defines the exact standards for implementing When To Use Async. By following this strict operational pattern, the engine guarantees deterministic execution, high performance, and complete adherence to all architectural guardrails established by the system design.

## 🛠️ Implementation SOP
Follow this step-by-step TDD procedure to execute the protocol:

- **Step 1: Baseline Context**: Verify the operational environment. Ensure required tools (like Python, Node, TS, or native CLI) are accessible before injecting new logic.
- **Step 2: Apply the Pattern**: Implement the core when to use async logic directly into the active system context.
- **Step 3: Enforce Constraints**: Check for syntax errors, injection vulnerabilities, and performance bottlenecks (`O(1)` compliance).
- **Step 4: Execute Test Suite**: Run `npm run test` or the local testing framework to ensure the logic passes all regression checks.
- **Step 5: Document and Commit**: Update the session walkthrough and sync the telemetry logs for the engineering sector.

# When to Use Async

```
async def is better when:
├── I/O-bound operations (database, HTTP, file)
├── Many concurrent connections
├── Real-time features
├── Microservices communication
└── FastAPI/Starlette/Django ASGI

def (sync) is better when:
├── CPU-bound operations
├── Simple scripts
├── Legacy codebase
├── Team unfamiliar with async
└── Blocking libraries (no async version)
