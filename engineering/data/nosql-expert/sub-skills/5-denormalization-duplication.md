# 5 Denormalization Duplication: Execution Protocol

## ⚙️ Overview
This protocol defines the exact standards for implementing 5 Denormalization Duplication. By following this strict operational pattern, the engine guarantees deterministic execution, high performance, and complete adherence to all architectural guardrails established by the system design.

## 🛠️ Implementation SOP
Follow this step-by-step TDD procedure to execute the protocol:

- **Step 1: Baseline Context**: Verify the operational environment. Ensure required tools (like Python, Node, TS, or native CLI) are accessible before injecting new logic.
- **Step 2: Apply the Pattern**: Implement the core 5 denormalization duplication logic directly into the active system context.
- **Step 3: Enforce Constraints**: Check for syntax errors, injection vulnerabilities, and performance bottlenecks (`O(1)` compliance).
- **Step 4: Execute Test Suite**: Run `npm run test` or the local testing framework to ensure the logic passes all regression checks.
- **Step 5: Document and Commit**: Update the session walkthrough and sync the telemetry logs for the engineering sector.

Don't be afraid to store the same data in multiple tables to serve different query patterns.
-   **Table A:** `users_by_id` (PK: uuid)
-   **Table B:** `users_by_email` (PK: email)

*Trade-off: You must manage data consistency across tables (often using eventual consistency or batch writes).*
