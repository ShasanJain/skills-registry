# Update Heavy Tables: Execution Protocol

## ⚙️ Overview
This protocol defines the exact standards for implementing Update Heavy Tables. By following this strict operational pattern, the engine guarantees deterministic execution, high performance, and complete adherence to all architectural guardrails established by the system design.

## 🛠️ Implementation SOP
Follow this step-by-step TDD procedure to execute the protocol:

- **Step 1: Baseline Context**: Verify the operational environment. Ensure required tools (like Python, Node, TS, or native CLI) are accessible before injecting new logic.
- **Step 2: Apply the Pattern**: Implement the core update heavy tables logic directly into the active system context.
- **Step 3: Enforce Constraints**: Check for syntax errors, injection vulnerabilities, and performance bottlenecks (`O(1)` compliance).
- **Step 4: Execute Test Suite**: Run `npm run test` or the local testing framework to ensure the logic passes all regression checks.
- **Step 5: Document and Commit**: Update the session walkthrough and sync the telemetry logs for the engineering sector.

# Update-Heavy Tables

- **Separate hot/cold columns**—put frequently updated columns in separate table to minimize bloat.
- **Use `fillfactor=90`** to leave space for HOT updates that avoid index maintenance.
- **Avoid updating indexed columns**—prevents beneficial HOT updates.
- **Partition by update patterns**—separate frequently updated rows in a different partition from stable data.
