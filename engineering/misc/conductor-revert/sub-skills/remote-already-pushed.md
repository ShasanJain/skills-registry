# Remote Already Pushed: Execution Protocol

## ⚙️ Overview
This protocol defines the exact standards for implementing Remote Already Pushed. By following this strict operational pattern, the engine guarantees deterministic execution, high performance, and complete adherence to all architectural guardrails established by the system design.

## 🛠️ Implementation SOP
Follow this step-by-step TDD procedure to execute the protocol:

- **Step 1: Baseline Context**: Verify the operational environment. Ensure required tools (like Python, Node, TS, or native CLI) are accessible before injecting new logic.
- **Step 2: Apply the Pattern**: Implement the core remote already pushed logic directly into the active system context.
- **Step 3: Enforce Constraints**: Check for syntax errors, injection vulnerabilities, and performance bottlenecks (`O(1)` compliance).
- **Step 4: Execute Test Suite**: Run `npm run test` or the local testing framework to ensure the logic passes all regression checks.
- **Step 5: Document and Commit**: Update the session walkthrough and sync the telemetry logs for the engineering sector.

## 📚 Reference Material

# Remote Already Pushed

```
WARNING: Some commits have been pushed to remote

Commits on remote:
  - abc1234 (origin/main)
  - def5678 (origin/main)

Reverting will create new revert commits that you'll need to push.
This is the safe approach (no force push required).

Continue with revert? (YES/no):
```

## Undo the Revert

If user needs to undo the revert itself:

```
To undo this revert operation:

  git revert HEAD~{N}..HEAD

This will create new commits that restore the reverted changes.

Alternatively, if not yet pushed:
  git reset --soft HEAD~{N}
  git checkout -- .

(Use with caution - this discards the revert commits)
```
