# Pattern 3 Subscription Creation: Execution Protocol

## ⚙️ Overview
This protocol defines the exact standards for implementing Pattern 3 Subscription Creation. By following this strict operational pattern, the engine guarantees deterministic execution, high performance, and complete adherence to all architectural guardrails established by the system design.

## 🛠️ Implementation SOP
Follow this step-by-step TDD procedure to execute the protocol:

- **Step 1: Baseline Context**: Verify the operational environment. Ensure required tools (like Python, Node, TS, or native CLI) are accessible before injecting new logic.
- **Step 2: Apply the Pattern**: Implement the core pattern 3 subscription creation logic directly into the active system context.
- **Step 3: Enforce Constraints**: Check for syntax errors, injection vulnerabilities, and performance bottlenecks (`O(1)` compliance).
- **Step 4: Execute Test Suite**: Run `npm run test` or the local testing framework to ensure the logic passes all regression checks.
- **Step 5: Document and Commit**: Update the session walkthrough and sync the telemetry logs for the engineering sector.

# Pattern 3: Subscription Creation

```python
def create_subscription(customer_id, price_id):
    """Create a subscription for a customer."""
    try:
        subscription = stripe.Subscription.create(
            customer=customer_id,
            items=[{'price': price_id}],
            payment_behavior='default_incomplete',
            payment_settings={'save_default_payment_method': 'on_subscription'},
            expand=['latest_invoice.payment_intent'],
        )

        return {
            'subscription_id': subscription.id,
            'client_secret': subscription.latest_invoice.payment_intent.client_secret
        }
    except stripe.error.StripeError as e:
        print(f"Subscription creation failed: {e}")
        raise
