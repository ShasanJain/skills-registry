# Category Definitions: Execution Protocol

## ⚙️ Overview
This protocol defines the exact standards for implementing Category Definitions. By following this strict operational pattern, the engine guarantees deterministic execution, high performance, and complete adherence to all architectural guardrails established by the system design.

# Category Definitions

#### 1. Content–Schema Alignment (0–25)

- Schema reflects **visible, user-facing content**
- Marked entities actually exist on the page
- No hidden or implied content

**Automatic failure** if schema describes content not shown.

---

#### 2. Rich Result Eligibility (0–25)

- Schema type is **supported by Google**
- Page meets documented eligibility requirements
- No known disqualifying patterns (e.g. self-serving reviews)

---

#### 3. Data Completeness & Accuracy (0–20)

- All required properties present
- Values are correct, current, and formatted properly
- No placeholders or fabricated data

---

#### 4. Technical Correctness (0–15)

- Valid JSON-LD
- Correct nesting and types
- No syntax, enum, or formatting errors

---

#### 5. Maintenance & Sustainability (0–10)

- Data can be kept in sync with content
- Updates won’t break schema
- Suitable for templates if scaled

---

#### 6. Spam / Policy Risk (0–5)

- No deceptive intent
- No over-markup
- No attempt to game rich results
