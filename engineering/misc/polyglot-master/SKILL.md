# Skill: Execution Protocol

## ⚙️ Overview
This protocol defines the exact standards for implementing Skill. By following this strict operational pattern, the engine guarantees deterministic execution, high performance, and complete adherence to all architectural guardrails established by the system design.

# 🌐 Polyglot Industrial Master
> **SOP Version**: 5.0.0-Industrial
> **Goal**: Elite Execution across All Major Programming Paradigms.

## 🛠️ 1. Systems & Low-Level (C, C++, Rust, Go)
- **C/C++**: Focus on memory ownership (`malloc`/`free`, smart pointers). Always compile with `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`. Use Valgrind for leak detection.
- **Rust**: Follow the Borrow Checker strictly. Prefer `Safe Rust`; justify any `unsafe` block with a technical comment. Use `clippy` for idiomatic linting.
- **Go**: Prioritize `channels` and `select` for concurrency. Keep interfaces small. Check all error return values explicitly.

## 🌐 2. Web & Scripting (JS, TS, Python, Ruby, PHP)
- **TypeScript/JS**: Use strict typing. Prefer `async/await` over promise chains. Optimize bundle size for browser; use native Node.js APIs for backend.
- **Python**: Follow **The Vectorization Rule** (NumPy/Pandas) for data. Use Type Hints (`Mypy`). Manage dependencies via `uv` or `poetry`.
- **Ruby**: Use idiomatic metaprogramming (modules/mixins). Follow Rails conventions (MVC).

## 🧮 3. Functional & Data (Haskell, Elixir, Scala, Julia)
- **Haskell**: Use expressive types (GADTs, Type Families). Isolate IO to pure boundaries.
- **Elixir**: Design for fault tolerance (Supervisors). Use OTP patterns for concurrency.
- **Julia**: Optimize for multiple dispatch and type stability.

## 🏢 4. Enterprise & Database (Java, C#, SQL)
- **Java/C#**: Use modern versions (Java 21+, C# 12+). Follow SOLID principles. Use Dependency Injection (Spring/Dotnet).
- **SQL**: Optimize via `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`. Index all foreign keys. Use CTEs for readability.

## 🛡️ 5. Language Anti-Patterns
- **❌ Memory Blindness**: Never ignore memory lifecycle in C/C++/Rust.
- **❌ Type Slop**: Avoid `any` in TS or `Object` in Java/C#.
- **❌ Callback Hell**: Use modern async primitives in all supported languages.

## ⌨️ Automation Tools
- `Jack /lint`: Detects the language and runs the appropriate ecosystem linter.
- `Jack /refactor [language]`: Modernizes legacy code to the latest language standards.
- `Jack /polyglot-test`: Runs a cross-language sanity check (e.g. verifying a Python backend against a TS frontend).
