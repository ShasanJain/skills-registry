# Pattern 1 Hybrid Search: Execution Protocol

## ⚙️ Overview
This protocol defines the exact standards for implementing Pattern 1 Hybrid Search. By following this strict operational pattern, the engine guarantees deterministic execution, high performance, and complete adherence to all architectural guardrails established by the system design.

## 🛠️ Implementation SOP
Follow this step-by-step TDD procedure to execute the protocol:

- **Step 1: Baseline Context**: Verify the operational environment. Ensure required tools (like Python, Node, TS, or native CLI) are accessible before injecting new logic.
- **Step 2: Apply the Pattern**: Implement the core pattern 1 hybrid search logic directly into the active system context.
- **Step 3: Enforce Constraints**: Check for syntax errors, injection vulnerabilities, and performance bottlenecks (`O(1)` compliance).
- **Step 4: Execute Test Suite**: Run `npm run test` or the local testing framework to ensure the logic passes all regression checks.
- **Step 5: Document and Commit**: Update the session walkthrough and sync the telemetry logs for the engineering sector.

# Pattern 1: Hybrid Search

```python
from langchain.retrievers import BM25Retriever, EnsembleRetriever

# Sparse retriever (BM25)
bm25_retriever = BM25Retriever.from_documents(chunks)
bm25_retriever.k = 5

# Dense retriever (embeddings)
embedding_retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(search_kwargs={"k": 5})

# Combine with weights
ensemble_retriever = EnsembleRetriever(
    retrievers=[bm25_retriever, embedding_retriever],
    weights=[0.3, 0.7]
)
```
