description: Use when executing encoding variants protocols within the engineering sector.

## 🛠️ Implementation SOP
Follow this step-by-step TDD procedure to execute the protocol:

- **Step 1: Baseline Context**: Verify the operational environment. Ensure required tools (like Python, Node, TS, or native CLI) are accessible before injecting new logic.
- **Step 2: Apply the Pattern**: Implement the core encoding variants logic directly into the active system context.
- **Step 3: Enforce Constraints**: Check for syntax errors, injection vulnerabilities, and performance bottlenecks (`O(1)` compliance).
- **Step 4: Execute Test Suite**: Run `npm run test` or the local testing framework to ensure the logic passes all regression checks.
- **Step 5: Document and Commit**: Update the session walkthrough and sync the telemetry logs for the engineering sector.

# Encoding Variants

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| URL Encoding | `%2e%2e%2f` = `../` |
| Double Encoding | `%252e%252e%252f` = `../` |
| Unicode | `%c0%af` = `/` |
| Null Byte | `%00` |
