# 2 Configure Https Server Port 443: Execution Protocol

## ⚙️ Overview
This protocol defines the exact standards for implementing 2 Configure Https Server Port 443. By following this strict operational pattern, the engine guarantees deterministic execution, high performance, and complete adherence to all architectural guardrails established by the system design.

## 🛠️ Implementation SOP
Follow this step-by-step TDD procedure to execute the protocol:

- **Step 1: Baseline Context**: Verify the operational environment. Ensure required tools (like Python, Node, TS, or native CLI) are accessible before injecting new logic.
- **Step 2: Apply the Pattern**: Implement the core 2 configure https server port 443 logic directly into the active system context.
- **Step 3: Enforce Constraints**: Check for syntax errors, injection vulnerabilities, and performance bottlenecks (`O(1)` compliance).
- **Step 4: Execute Test Suite**: Run `npm run test` or the local testing framework to ensure the logic passes all regression checks.
- **Step 5: Document and Commit**: Update the session walkthrough and sync the telemetry logs for the engineering sector.

# 2. Configure HTTPS Server (Port 443)

Set up secure HTTPS with SSL/TLS:

**Generate Self-Signed Certificate:**

```bash
# Linux - Generate certificate
sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
  -keyout /etc/ssl/private/apache-selfsigned.key \
  -out /etc/ssl/certs/apache-selfsigned.crt

# Enable SSL module
sudo a2enmod ssl
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

**Configure Apache for HTTPS:**

```bash
# Edit SSL virtual host
sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl.conf

# Enable site
sudo a2ensite default-ssl
sudo systemctl reload apache2
```

**Verify HTTPS Setup:**

```bash
# Check port 443 is open
nmap -p 443 192.168.1.1

# Test SSL connection
openssl s_client -connect 192.168.1.1:443

# Check certificate
curl -kv https://192.168.1.1
```
