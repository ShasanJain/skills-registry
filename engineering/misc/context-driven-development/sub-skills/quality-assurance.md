# Quality Assurance: Execution Protocol

## ⚙️ Overview
This protocol defines the exact standards for implementing Quality Assurance. By following this strict operational pattern, the engine guarantees deterministic execution, high performance, and complete adherence to all architectural guardrails established by the system design.

# Quality Assurance

- Standards are explicit and verifiable
- Deviations from context are detectable
- Quality gates are documented and enforceable

## Context Lifecycle

1. **Creation**: Initial setup via `/conductor:setup`
2. **Validation**: Verify before each track
3. **Evolution**: Update as project grows
4. **Synchronization**: Keep artifacts aligned
5. **Archival**: Document historical decisions

## Context Validation Checklist

Before starting implementation on any track, validate context:
