# 5 Task Completion: Execution Protocol

## ⚙️ Overview
This protocol defines the exact standards for implementing 5 Task Completion. By following this strict operational pattern, the engine guarantees deterministic execution, high performance, and complete adherence to all architectural guardrails established by the system design.

## 🛠️ Implementation SOP
Follow this step-by-step TDD procedure to execute the protocol:

- **Step 1: Baseline Context**: Verify the operational environment. Ensure required tools (like Python, Node, TS, or native CLI) are accessible before injecting new logic.
- **Step 2: Apply the Pattern**: Implement the core 5 task completion logic directly into the active system context.
- **Step 3: Enforce Constraints**: Check for syntax errors, injection vulnerabilities, and performance bottlenecks (`O(1)` compliance).
- **Step 4: Execute Test Suite**: Run `npm run test` or the local testing framework to ensure the logic passes all regression checks.
- **Step 5: Document and Commit**: Update the session walkthrough and sync the telemetry logs for the engineering sector.

# 5. Task Completion

**Commit changes** (following commit strategy from workflow.md):

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "{commit_prefix}: {task description} ({trackId})"
```

**Update plan.md:**

- Change `[~]` to `[x]` for completed task
- Commit plan update:

```bash
git add conductor/tracks/{trackId}/plan.md
git commit -m "chore: mark task X.Y complete ({trackId})"
```

**Update metadata.json:**

- Increment `tasks.completed`
- Update `updated` timestamp
