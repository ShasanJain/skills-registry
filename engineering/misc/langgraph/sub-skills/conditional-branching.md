# Conditional Branching: Execution Protocol

## ⚙️ Overview
This protocol defines the exact standards for implementing Conditional Branching. By following this strict operational pattern, the engine guarantees deterministic execution, high performance, and complete adherence to all architectural guardrails established by the system design.

## 🛠️ Implementation SOP
Follow this step-by-step TDD procedure to execute the protocol:

- **Step 1: Baseline Context**: Verify the operational environment. Ensure required tools (like Python, Node, TS, or native CLI) are accessible before injecting new logic.
- **Step 2: Apply the Pattern**: Implement the core conditional branching logic directly into the active system context.
- **Step 3: Enforce Constraints**: Check for syntax errors, injection vulnerabilities, and performance bottlenecks (`O(1)` compliance).
- **Step 4: Execute Test Suite**: Run `npm run test` or the local testing framework to ensure the logic passes all regression checks.
- **Step 5: Document and Commit**: Update the session walkthrough and sync the telemetry logs for the engineering sector.

# Conditional Branching

Route to different paths based on state

**When to use**: Multiple possible workflows

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END

class RouterState(TypedDict):
    query: str
    query_type: str
    result: str

def classifier(state: RouterState) -> dict:
    """Classify the query type."""
    query = state["query"].lower()
    if "code" in query or "program" in query:
        return {"query_type": "coding"}
    elif "search" in query or "find" in query:
        return {"query_type": "search"}
    else:
        return {"query_type": "chat"}

def coding_agent(state: RouterState) -> dict:
    return {"result": "Here's your code..."}

def search_agent(state: RouterState) -> dict:
    return {"result": "Search results..."}

def chat_agent(state: RouterState) -> dict:
    return {"result": "Let me help..."}

# Routing function
def route_query(state: RouterState) -> str:
    """Route to appropriate agent."""
    query_type = state["query_type"]
    return query_type  # Returns node name

# Build graph
graph = StateGraph(RouterState)

graph.add_node("classifier", classifier)
graph.add_node("coding", coding_agent)
graph.add_node("search", search_agent)
graph.add_node("chat", chat_agent)

graph.add_edge(START, "classifier")

# Conditional edges from classifier
graph.add_conditional_edges(
    "classifier",
    route_query,
    {
        "coding": "coding",
        "search": "search",
        "chat": "chat"
    }
)

# All agents lead to END
graph.add_edge("coding", END)
graph.add_edge("search", END)
graph.add_edge("chat", END)

app = graph.compile()
```
