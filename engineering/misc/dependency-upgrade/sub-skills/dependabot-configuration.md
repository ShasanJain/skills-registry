# Dependabot Configuration: Execution Protocol

## ⚙️ Overview
This protocol defines the exact standards for implementing Dependabot Configuration. By following this strict operational pattern, the engine guarantees deterministic execution, high performance, and complete adherence to all architectural guardrails established by the system design.

## 🛠️ Implementation SOP
Follow this step-by-step TDD procedure to execute the protocol:

- **Step 1: Baseline Context**: Verify the operational environment. Ensure required tools (like Python, Node, TS, or native CLI) are accessible before injecting new logic.
- **Step 2: Apply the Pattern**: Implement the core dependabot configuration logic directly into the active system context.
- **Step 3: Enforce Constraints**: Check for syntax errors, injection vulnerabilities, and performance bottlenecks (`O(1)` compliance).
- **Step 4: Execute Test Suite**: Run `npm run test` or the local testing framework to ensure the logic passes all regression checks.
- **Step 5: Document and Commit**: Update the session walkthrough and sync the telemetry logs for the engineering sector.

## 📚 Reference Material

# Dependabot Configuration

```yaml
# .github/dependabot.yml
version: 4.1.0-fractal
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "npm"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    open-pull-requests-limit: 5
    reviewers:
      - "team-leads"
    commit-message:
      prefix: "chore"
      include: "scope"
```

## Rollback Plan

```javascript
// rollback.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Save current state
git stash
git checkout -b upgrade-branch

# Attempt upgrade
npm install package@latest

# Run tests
if npm run test; then
  echo "Upgrade successful"
  git add package.json package-lock.json
  git commit -m "chore: upgrade package"
else
  echo "Upgrade failed, rolling back"
  git checkout main
  git branch -D upgrade-branch
  npm install  # Restore from package-lock.json
fi
```
