# Advanced Task Tool Parameters: Execution Protocol

## ⚙️ Overview
This protocol defines the exact standards for implementing Advanced Task Tool Parameters. By following this strict operational pattern, the engine guarantees deterministic execution, high performance, and complete adherence to all architectural guardrails established by the system design.

## 🛠️ Implementation SOP
Follow this step-by-step TDD procedure to execute the protocol:

- **Step 1: Baseline Context**: Verify the operational environment. Ensure required tools (like Python, Node, TS, or native CLI) are accessible before injecting new logic.
- **Step 2: Apply the Pattern**: Implement the core advanced task tool parameters logic directly into the active system context.
- **Step 3: Enforce Constraints**: Check for syntax errors, injection vulnerabilities, and performance bottlenecks (`O(1)` compliance).
- **Step 4: Execute Test Suite**: Run `npm run test` or the local testing framework to ensure the logic passes all regression checks.
- **Step 5: Document and Commit**: Update the session walkthrough and sync the telemetry logs for the engineering sector.

## 📚 Reference Material

# Advanced Task Tool Parameters

**Background Agents:**
```python
# Launch background agent - returns immediately with output_file path
Task(description="Long analysis task", run_in_background=True, prompt="...")
# Output truncated to 30K chars - use Read tool to check full output file
```

**Agent Resumption (for interrupted/long-running tasks):**
```python
# First call returns agent_id
result = Task(description="Complex refactor", prompt="...")
# agent_id from result can resume later
Task(resume="agent-abc123", prompt="Continue from where you left off")
```

**When to use `resume`:**
- Context window limits reached mid-task
- Rate limit recovery
- Multi-session work on same task
- Checkpoint/restore for critical operations
