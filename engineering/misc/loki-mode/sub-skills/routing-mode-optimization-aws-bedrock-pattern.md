## 🛠️ Implementation SOP
Follow this step-by-step TDD procedure to execute the protocol:

- **Step 1: Baseline Context**: Verify the operational environment. Ensure required tools (like Python, Node, TS, or native CLI) are accessible before injecting new logic.
- **Step 2: Apply the Pattern**: Implement the core routing mode optimization aws bedrock pattern logic directly into the active system context.
- **Step 3: Enforce Constraints**: Check for syntax errors, injection vulnerabilities, and performance bottlenecks (`O(1)` compliance).
- **Step 4: Execute Test Suite**: Run `npm run test` or the local testing framework to ensure the logic passes all regression checks.
- **Step 5: Document and Commit**: Update the session walkthrough and sync the telemetry logs for the engineering sector.

# Routing Mode Optimization (AWS Bedrock Pattern)

**Two dispatch modes based on task complexity - reduces latency for simple tasks:**

| Mode | When to Use | Behavior |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Direct Routing** | Simple, single-domain tasks | Route directly to specialist agent, skip orchestration |
| **Supervisor Mode** | Complex, multi-step tasks | Full decomposition, coordination, result synthesis |

**Decision Logic:**
```
Task Received
    |
    +-- Is task single-domain? (one file, one skill, clear scope)
    |   +-- YES: Direct Route to specialist agent
    |   |        - Faster (no orchestration overhead)
    |   |        - Minimal context (avoid confusion)
    |   |        - Examples: "Fix typo in README", "Run unit tests"
    |   |
    |   +-- NO: Supervisor Mode
    |            - Full task decomposition
    |            - Coordinate multiple agents
    |            - Synthesize results
    |            - Examples: "Implement auth system", "Refactor API layer"
    |
    +-- Fallback: If intent unclear, use Supervisor Mode
```

**Direct Routing Examples (Skip Orchestration):**
```python
# Simple tasks -> Direct dispatch to Haiku
Task(model="haiku", description="Fix import in utils.py", prompt="...")       # Direct
Task(model="haiku", description="Run linter on src/", prompt="...")           # Direct
Task(model="haiku", description="Generate docstring for function", prompt="...")  # Direct

# Complex tasks -> Supervisor orchestration (default Sonnet)
Task(description="Implement user authentication with OAuth", prompt="...")    # Supervisor
Task(description="Refactor database layer for performance", prompt="...")     # Supervisor
```

**Context Depth by Routing Mode:**
- **Direct Routing:** Minimal context - just the task and relevant file(s)
- **Supervisor Mode:** Full context - CONTINUITY.md, architectural decisions, dependencies
