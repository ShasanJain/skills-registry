# 82 Common Migration Steps: Execution Protocol

## ⚙️ Overview
This protocol defines the exact standards for implementing 82 Common Migration Steps. By following this strict operational pattern, the engine guarantees deterministic execution, high performance, and complete adherence to all architectural guardrails established by the system design.

## 🛠️ Implementation SOP
Follow this step-by-step TDD procedure to execute the protocol:

- **Step 1: Baseline Context**: Verify the operational environment. Ensure required tools (like Python, Node, TS, or native CLI) are accessible before injecting new logic.
- **Step 2: Apply the Pattern**: Implement the core 82 common migration steps logic directly into the active system context.
- **Step 3: Enforce Constraints**: Check for syntax errors, injection vulnerabilities, and performance bottlenecks (`O(1)` compliance).
- **Step 4: Execute Test Suite**: Run `npm run test` or the local testing framework to ensure the logic passes all regression checks.
- **Step 5: Document and Commit**: Update the session walkthrough and sync the telemetry logs for the engineering sector.

# 8.2 Common Migration Steps

```bash
# 1. Install Bun
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

# 2. Replace package manager
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
bun install

# 3. Update scripts in package.json
# "start": "node index.js" → "start": "bun run index.ts"
# "test": "jest" → "test": "bun test"

# 4. Add Bun types
bun add -d @types/bun
