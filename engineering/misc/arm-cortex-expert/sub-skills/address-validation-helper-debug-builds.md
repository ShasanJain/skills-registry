# Address Validation Helper Debug Builds: Execution Protocol

## ⚙️ Overview
This protocol defines the exact standards for implementing Address Validation Helper Debug Builds. By following this strict operational pattern, the engine guarantees deterministic execution, high performance, and complete adherence to all architectural guardrails established by the system design.

## 🛠️ Implementation SOP
Follow this step-by-step TDD procedure to execute the protocol:

- **Step 1: Baseline Context**: Verify the operational environment. Ensure required tools (like Python, Node, TS, or native CLI) are accessible before injecting new logic.
- **Step 2: Apply the Pattern**: Implement the core address validation helper debug builds logic directly into the active system context.
- **Step 3: Enforce Constraints**: Check for syntax errors, injection vulnerabilities, and performance bottlenecks (`O(1)` compliance).
- **Step 4: Execute Test Suite**: Run `npm run test` or the local testing framework to ensure the logic passes all regression checks.
- **Step 5: Document and Commit**: Update the session walkthrough and sync the telemetry logs for the engineering sector.

# Address Validation Helper (Debug Builds)

**Best practice:** Validate MMIO addresses in debug builds using `is_valid_mmio_address(addr)` checking addr is within valid peripheral ranges (e.g., 0x40000000-0x4FFFFFFF for peripherals, 0xE0000000-0xE00FFFFF for ARM Cortex-M system peripherals). Use `#ifdef DEBUG` guards and halt on invalid addresses.
