# Skill: Execution Protocol

## ⚙️ Overview
This protocol defines the exact standards for implementing Skill. By following this strict operational pattern, the engine guarantees deterministic execution, high performance, and complete adherence to all architectural guardrails established by the system design.

# 🔌 Third-Party Integrations Master
> **SOP Version**: 5.0.0-Industrial
> **Goal**: Rapid, Secure Connection to External Vendor Ecosystems.

## 🟠 1. HubSpot (CRM & Sales)
- **Auth**: Always prefer **Private App Tokens** for server-to-server or OAuth for multi-tenant.
- **Batching**: Use the `/batch` endpoints for any operation > 10 objects to avoid rate limits.
- **Object Mapping**: Map custom properties to `snake_case` in local state; convert to HubSpot's required schema during sync.

## 🛍️ 2. Shopify (Commerce & Retail)
- **APIs**: Use **Storefront API** (GraphQL) for customer-facing and **Admin API** for backend management.
- **Webhooks**: Always verify the `X-Shopify-Hmac-Sha256` header.
- **Rate Limits**: Respect the "Leaky Bucket" algorithm (standard is 2 requests per second).

## 📒 3. Notion (Knowledge & Workspace)
- **MCP Tool**: Use the `notion-mcp` for searching pages and updating databases.
- **Structure**: Treat Notion as a **Block Tree**. When writing, prioritize readability and nesting.
- **Querying**: Use filters and sorts at the database level to minimize payload size.

## 💳 4. Plaid & Stripe (Fintech & Payments)
- **Safety**: NEVER store raw credit card data or PII. Use tokens/IDs.
- **Webhooks**: Mandatory for handling asynchronous events (e.g., `payment_intent.succeeded`).
- **Idempotency**: Always send an `Idempotency-Key` for write operations to prevent double-charging.

## 🛡️ 5. Integration Anti-Patterns
- **❌ Individual Syncs**: Never loop over individual API calls; use Batch/Bulk endpoints.
- **❌ Polling**: Never poll an API for changes; set up Webhooks.
- **❌ Hardcoded Keys**: Use `.env` and secret managers.

## ⌨️ Automation Tools
- `Jack /test-webhook [url]`: Simulates a vendor webhook to test local handling.
- `Jack /sync-schema [vendor]`: Maps a local DB schema to a vendor's API schema.
