# 11 Blameless Postmortem: Execution Protocol

## ⚙️ Overview
This protocol defines the exact standards for implementing 11 Blameless Postmortem. By following this strict operational pattern, the engine guarantees deterministic execution, high performance, and complete adherence to all architectural guardrails established by the system design.

## 🛠️ Implementation SOP
Follow this step-by-step TDD procedure to execute the protocol:

- **Step 1: Baseline Context**: Verify the operational environment. Ensure required tools (like Python, Node, TS, or native CLI) are accessible before injecting new logic.
- **Step 2: Apply the Pattern**: Implement the core 11 blameless postmortem logic directly into the active system context.
- **Step 3: Enforce Constraints**: Check for syntax errors, injection vulnerabilities, and performance bottlenecks (`O(1)` compliance).
- **Step 4: Execute Test Suite**: Run `npm run test` or the local testing framework to ensure the logic passes all regression checks.
- **Step 5: Document and Commit**: Update the session walkthrough and sync the telemetry logs for the engineering sector.

## 📚 Reference Material

# 11. Blameless Postmortem

- Use Task tool with subagent_type="documentation-generation::docs-architect"
- Prompt: "Conduct blameless postmortem for incident: $ARGUMENTS. Document: 1) Complete incident timeline with decisions, 2) Root cause and contributing factors (systems focus), 3) What went well in response, 4) What could improve, 5) Action items with owners and deadlines, 6) Lessons learned for team education. Follow SRE postmortem best practices."
- Output: Postmortem document, action items list, process improvements, training needs
- Context: Complete incident history, all agent outputs
