# 2 Pattern Selection Matrix: Execution Protocol

## ⚙️ Overview
This protocol defines the exact standards for implementing 2 Pattern Selection Matrix. By following this strict operational pattern, the engine guarantees deterministic execution, high performance, and complete adherence to all architectural guardrails established by the system design.

## 🛠️ Implementation SOP
Follow this step-by-step TDD procedure to execute the protocol:

- **Step 1: Baseline Context**: Verify the operational environment. Ensure required tools (like Python, Node, TS, or native CLI) are accessible before injecting new logic.
- **Step 2: Apply the Pattern**: Implement the core 2 pattern selection matrix logic directly into the active system context.
- **Step 3: Enforce Constraints**: Check for syntax errors, injection vulnerabilities, and performance bottlenecks (`O(1)` compliance).
- **Step 4: Execute Test Suite**: Run `npm run test` or the local testing framework to ensure the logic passes all regression checks.
- **Step 5: Document and Commit**: Update the session walkthrough and sync the telemetry logs for the engineering sector.

# 2. Pattern Selection Matrix

| Pattern | Use When | Example |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **State Machine** | 3-5 discrete states | Player: Idle→Walk→Jump |
| **Object Pooling** | Frequent spawn/destroy | Bullets, particles |
| **Observer/Events** | Cross-system communication | Health→UI updates |
| **ECS** | Thousands of similar entities | RTS units, particles |
| **Command** | Undo, replay, networking | Input recording |
| **Behavior Tree** | Complex AI decisions | Enemy AI |

**Decision Rule:** Start with State Machine. Add ECS only when performance demands.
