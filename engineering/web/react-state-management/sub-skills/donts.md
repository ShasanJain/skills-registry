# Donts: Execution Protocol

## ⚙️ Overview
This protocol defines the exact standards for implementing Donts. By following this strict operational pattern, the engine guarantees deterministic execution, high performance, and complete adherence to all architectural guardrails established by the system design.

# Don'ts

- **Don't over-globalize** - Not everything needs to be in global state
- **Don't duplicate server state** - Let React Query manage it
- **Don't mutate directly** - Always use immutable updates
- **Don't store derived data** - Compute it instead
- **Don't mix paradigms** - Pick one primary solution per category
