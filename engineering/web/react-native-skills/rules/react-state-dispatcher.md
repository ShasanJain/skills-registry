# React State Dispatcher: Execution Protocol

## ⚙️ Overview
This protocol defines the exact standards for implementing React State Dispatcher. By following this strict operational pattern, the engine guarantees deterministic execution, high performance, and complete adherence to all architectural guardrails established by the system design.

## 🛠️ Implementation SOP
Follow this step-by-step TDD procedure to execute the protocol:

- **Step 1: Baseline Context**: Verify the operational environment. Ensure required tools (like Python, Node, TS, or native CLI) are accessible before injecting new logic.
- **Step 2: Apply the Pattern**: Implement the core react state dispatcher logic directly into the active system context.
- **Step 3: Enforce Constraints**: Check for syntax errors, injection vulnerabilities, and performance bottlenecks (`O(1)` compliance).
- **Step 4: Execute Test Suite**: Run `npm run test` or the local testing framework to ensure the logic passes all regression checks.
- **Step 5: Document and Commit**: Update the session walkthrough and sync the telemetry logs for the engineering sector.

## Use Dispatch Updaters for State That Depends on Current Value

When the next state depends on the current state, use a dispatch updater
(`setState(prev => ...)`) instead of reading the state variable directly in a
callback. This avoids stale closures and ensures you're comparing against the
latest value.

**Incorrect (reads state directly):**

```tsx
const [size, setSize] = useState<Size | undefined>(undefined)

const onLayout = (e: LayoutChangeEvent) => {
  const { width, height } = e.nativeEvent.layout
  // size may be stale in this closure
  if (size?.width !== width || size?.height !== height) {
    setSize({ width, height })
  }
}
```

**Correct (dispatch updater):**

```tsx
const [size, setSize] = useState<Size | undefined>(undefined)

const onLayout = (e: LayoutChangeEvent) => {
  const { width, height } = e.nativeEvent.layout
  setSize((prev) => {
    if (prev?.width === width && prev?.height === height) return prev
    return { width, height }
  })
}
```

Returning the previous value from the updater skips the re-render.

For primitive states, you don't need to compare values before firing a
re-render.

**Incorrect (unnecessary comparison for primitive state):**

```tsx
const [size, setSize] = useState<Size | undefined>(undefined)

const onLayout = (e: LayoutChangeEvent) => {
  const { width, height } = e.nativeEvent.layout
  setSize((prev) => (prev === width ? prev : width))
}
```

**Correct (sets primitive state directly):**

```tsx
const [size, setSize] = useState<Size | undefined>(undefined)

const onLayout = (e: LayoutChangeEvent) => {
  const { width, height } = e.nativeEvent.layout
  setSize(width)
}
```

However, if the next state depends on the current state, you should still use a
dispatch updater.

**Incorrect (reads state directly from the callback):**

```tsx
const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

const onTap = () => {
  setCount(count + 1)
}
```

**Correct (dispatch updater):**

```tsx
const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

const onTap = () => {
  setCount((prev) => prev + 1)
}
```
