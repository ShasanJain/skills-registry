# Monorepo Native Deps In App: Execution Protocol

## ⚙️ Overview
This protocol defines the exact standards for implementing Monorepo Native Deps In App. By following this strict operational pattern, the engine guarantees deterministic execution, high performance, and complete adherence to all architectural guardrails established by the system design.

## 🛠️ Implementation SOP
Follow this step-by-step TDD procedure to execute the protocol:

- **Step 1: Baseline Context**: Verify the operational environment. Ensure required tools (like Python, Node, TS, or native CLI) are accessible before injecting new logic.
- **Step 2: Apply the Pattern**: Implement the core monorepo native deps in app logic directly into the active system context.
- **Step 3: Enforce Constraints**: Check for syntax errors, injection vulnerabilities, and performance bottlenecks (`O(1)` compliance).
- **Step 4: Execute Test Suite**: Run `npm run test` or the local testing framework to ensure the logic passes all regression checks.
- **Step 5: Document and Commit**: Update the session walkthrough and sync the telemetry logs for the engineering sector.

## Install Native Dependencies in App Directory

In a monorepo, packages with native code must be installed in the native app's
directory directly. Autolinking only scans the app's `node_modules`—it won't
find native dependencies installed in other packages.

**Incorrect (native dep in shared package only):**

```
packages/
  ui/
    package.json  # has react-native-reanimated
  app/
    package.json  # missing react-native-reanimated
```

Autolinking fails—native code not linked.

**Correct (native dep in app directory):**

```
packages/
  ui/
    package.json  # has react-native-reanimated
  app/
    package.json  # also has react-native-reanimated
```

```json
// packages/app/package.json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react-native-reanimated": "3.16.1"
  }
}
```

Even if the shared package uses the native dependency, the app must also list it
for autolinking to detect and link the native code.
