# React Compiler Destructure Functions: Execution Protocol

## ⚙️ Overview
This protocol defines the exact standards for implementing React Compiler Destructure Functions. By following this strict operational pattern, the engine guarantees deterministic execution, high performance, and complete adherence to all architectural guardrails established by the system design.

## 🛠️ Implementation SOP
Follow this step-by-step TDD procedure to execute the protocol:

- **Step 1: Baseline Context**: Verify the operational environment. Ensure required tools (like Python, Node, TS, or native CLI) are accessible before injecting new logic.
- **Step 2: Apply the Pattern**: Implement the core react compiler destructure functions logic directly into the active system context.
- **Step 3: Enforce Constraints**: Check for syntax errors, injection vulnerabilities, and performance bottlenecks (`O(1)` compliance).
- **Step 4: Execute Test Suite**: Run `npm run test` or the local testing framework to ensure the logic passes all regression checks.
- **Step 5: Document and Commit**: Update the session walkthrough and sync the telemetry logs for the engineering sector.

## Destructure Functions Early in Render

This rule is only applicable if you are using the React Compiler.

Destructure functions from hooks at the top of render scope. Never dot into
objects to call functions. Destructured functions are stable references; dotting
creates new references and breaks memoization.

**Incorrect (dotting into object):**

```tsx
import { useRouter } from 'expo-router'

function SaveButton(props) {
  const router = useRouter()

  // bad: react-compiler will key the cache on "props" and "router", which are objects that change each render
  const handlePress = () => {
    props.onSave()
    router.push('/success') // unstable reference
  }

  return <Button onPress={handlePress}>Save</Button>
}
```

**Correct (destructure early):**

```tsx
import { useRouter } from 'expo-router'

function SaveButton({ onSave }) {
  const { push } = useRouter()

  // good: react-compiler will key on push and onSave
  const handlePress = () => {
    onSave()
    push('/success') // stable reference
  }

  return <Button onPress={handlePress}>Save</Button>
}
```
