# Rerender Split Combined Hooks: Execution Protocol

## ⚙️ Overview
This protocol defines the exact standards for implementing Rerender Split Combined Hooks. By following this strict operational pattern, the engine guarantees deterministic execution, high performance, and complete adherence to all architectural guardrails established by the system design.

## 🛠️ Implementation SOP
Follow this step-by-step TDD procedure to execute the protocol:

- **Step 1: Baseline Context**: Verify the operational environment. Ensure required tools (like Python, Node, TS, or native CLI) are accessible before injecting new logic.
- **Step 2: Apply the Pattern**: Implement the core rerender split combined hooks logic directly into the active system context.
- **Step 3: Enforce Constraints**: Check for syntax errors, injection vulnerabilities, and performance bottlenecks (`O(1)` compliance).
- **Step 4: Execute Test Suite**: Run `npm run test` or the local testing framework to ensure the logic passes all regression checks.
- **Step 5: Document and Commit**: Update the session walkthrough and sync the telemetry logs for the engineering sector.

## Split Combined Hook Computations

When a hook contains multiple independent tasks with different dependencies, split them into separate hooks. A combined hook reruns all tasks when any dependency changes, even if some tasks don't use the changed value.

**Incorrect (changing `sortOrder` recomputes filtering):**

```tsx
const sortedProducts = useMemo(() => {
  const filtered = products.filter((p) => p.category === category)
  const sorted = filtered.toSorted((a, b) =>
    sortOrder === "asc" ? a.price - b.price : b.price - a.price
  )
  return sorted
}, [products, category, sortOrder])
```

**Correct (filtering only recomputes when products or category change):**

```tsx
const filteredProducts = useMemo(
  () => products.filter((p) => p.category === category),
  [products, category]
)

const sortedProducts = useMemo(
  () =>
    filteredProducts.toSorted((a, b) =>
      sortOrder === "asc" ? a.price - b.price : b.price - a.price
    ),
  [filteredProducts, sortOrder]
)
```

This pattern also applies to `useEffect` when combining unrelated side effects:

**Incorrect (both effects run when either dependency changes):**

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  analytics.trackPageView(pathname)
  document.title = `${pageTitle} | My App`
}, [pathname, pageTitle])
```

**Correct (effects run independently):**

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  analytics.trackPageView(pathname)
}, [pathname])

useEffect(() => {
  document.title = `${pageTitle} | My App`
}, [pageTitle])
```

**Note:** If your project has [React Compiler](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler) enabled, it automatically optimizes dependency tracking and may handle some of these cases for you.
