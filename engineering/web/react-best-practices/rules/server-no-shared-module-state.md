# Server No Shared Module State: Execution Protocol

## ⚙️ Overview
This protocol defines the exact standards for implementing Server No Shared Module State. By following this strict operational pattern, the engine guarantees deterministic execution, high performance, and complete adherence to all architectural guardrails established by the system design.

## 🛠️ Implementation SOP
Follow this step-by-step TDD procedure to execute the protocol:

- **Step 1: Baseline Context**: Verify the operational environment. Ensure required tools (like Python, Node, TS, or native CLI) are accessible before injecting new logic.
- **Step 2: Apply the Pattern**: Implement the core server no shared module state logic directly into the active system context.
- **Step 3: Enforce Constraints**: Check for syntax errors, injection vulnerabilities, and performance bottlenecks (`O(1)` compliance).
- **Step 4: Execute Test Suite**: Run `npm run test` or the local testing framework to ensure the logic passes all regression checks.
- **Step 5: Document and Commit**: Update the session walkthrough and sync the telemetry logs for the engineering sector.

## Avoid Shared Module State for Request Data

For React Server Components and client components rendered during SSR, avoid using mutable module-level variables to share request-scoped data. Server renders can run concurrently in the same process. If one render writes to shared module state and another render reads it, you can get race conditions, cross-request contamination, and security bugs where one user's data appears in another user's response.

Treat module scope on the server as process-wide shared memory, not request-local state.

**Incorrect (request data leaks across concurrent renders):**

```tsx
let currentUser: User | null = null

export default async function Page() {
  currentUser = await auth()
  return <Dashboard />
}

async function Dashboard() {
  return <div>{currentUser?.name}</div>
}
```

If two requests overlap, request A can set `currentUser`, then request B overwrites it before request A finishes rendering `Dashboard`.

**Correct (keep request data local to the render tree):**

```tsx
export default async function Page() {
  const user = await auth()
  return <Dashboard user={user} />
}

function Dashboard({ user }: { user: User | null }) {
  return <div>{user?.name}</div>
}
```

Safe exceptions:

- Immutable static assets or config loaded once at module scope
- Shared caches intentionally designed for cross-request reuse and keyed correctly
- Process-wide singletons that do not store request- or user-specific mutable data

For static assets and config, see [Hoist Static I/O to Module Level](./server-hoist-static-io.md).
