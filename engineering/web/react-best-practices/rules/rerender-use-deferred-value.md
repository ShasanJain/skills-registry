# Rerender Use Deferred Value: Execution Protocol

## ⚙️ Overview
This protocol defines the exact standards for implementing Rerender Use Deferred Value. By following this strict operational pattern, the engine guarantees deterministic execution, high performance, and complete adherence to all architectural guardrails established by the system design.

## 🛠️ Implementation SOP
Follow this step-by-step TDD procedure to execute the protocol:

- **Step 1: Baseline Context**: Verify the operational environment. Ensure required tools (like Python, Node, TS, or native CLI) are accessible before injecting new logic.
- **Step 2: Apply the Pattern**: Implement the core rerender use deferred value logic directly into the active system context.
- **Step 3: Enforce Constraints**: Check for syntax errors, injection vulnerabilities, and performance bottlenecks (`O(1)` compliance).
- **Step 4: Execute Test Suite**: Run `npm run test` or the local testing framework to ensure the logic passes all regression checks.
- **Step 5: Document and Commit**: Update the session walkthrough and sync the telemetry logs for the engineering sector.

## Use useDeferredValue for Expensive Derived Renders

When user input triggers expensive computations or renders, use `useDeferredValue` to keep the input responsive. The deferred value lags behind, allowing React to prioritize the input update and render the expensive result when idle.

**Incorrect (input feels laggy while filtering):**

```tsx
function Search({ items }: { items: Item[] }) {
  const [query, setQuery] = useState('')
  const filtered = items.filter(item => fuzzyMatch(item, query))

  return (
    <>
      <input value={query} onChange={e => setQuery(e.target.value)} />
      <ResultsList results={filtered} />
    </>
  )
}
```

**Correct (input stays snappy, results render when ready):**

```tsx
function Search({ items }: { items: Item[] }) {
  const [query, setQuery] = useState('')
  const deferredQuery = useDeferredValue(query)
  const filtered = useMemo(
    () => items.filter(item => fuzzyMatch(item, deferredQuery)),
    [items, deferredQuery]
  )
  const isStale = query !== deferredQuery

  return (
    <>
      <input value={query} onChange={e => setQuery(e.target.value)} />
      <div style={{ opacity: isStale ? 0.7 : 1 }}>
        <ResultsList results={filtered} />
      </div>
    </>
  )
}
```

**When to use:**

- Filtering/searching large lists
- Expensive visualizations (charts, graphs) reacting to input
- Any derived state that causes noticeable render delays

**Note:** Wrap the expensive computation in `useMemo` with the deferred value as a dependency, otherwise it still runs on every render.
