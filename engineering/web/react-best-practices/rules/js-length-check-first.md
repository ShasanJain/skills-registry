# Js Length Check First: Execution Protocol

## ⚙️ Overview
This protocol defines the exact standards for implementing Js Length Check First. By following this strict operational pattern, the engine guarantees deterministic execution, high performance, and complete adherence to all architectural guardrails established by the system design.

## 🛠️ Implementation SOP
Follow this step-by-step TDD procedure to execute the protocol:

- **Step 1: Baseline Context**: Verify the operational environment. Ensure required tools (like Python, Node, TS, or native CLI) are accessible before injecting new logic.
- **Step 2: Apply the Pattern**: Implement the core js length check first logic directly into the active system context.
- **Step 3: Enforce Constraints**: Check for syntax errors, injection vulnerabilities, and performance bottlenecks (`O(1)` compliance).
- **Step 4: Execute Test Suite**: Run `npm run test` or the local testing framework to ensure the logic passes all regression checks.
- **Step 5: Document and Commit**: Update the session walkthrough and sync the telemetry logs for the engineering sector.

## Early Length Check for Array Comparisons

When comparing arrays with expensive operations (sorting, deep equality, serialization), check lengths first. If lengths differ, the arrays cannot be equal.

In real-world applications, this optimization is especially valuable when the comparison runs in hot paths (event handlers, render loops).

**Incorrect (always runs expensive comparison):**

```typescript
function hasChanges(current: string[], original: string[]) {
  // Always sorts and joins, even when lengths differ
  return current.sort().join() !== original.sort().join()
}
```

Two O(n log n) sorts run even when `current.length` is 5 and `original.length` is 100. There is also overhead of joining the arrays and comparing the strings.

**Correct (O(1) length check first):**

```typescript
function hasChanges(current: string[], original: string[]) {
  // Early return if lengths differ
  if (current.length !== original.length) {
    return true
  }
  // Only sort when lengths match
  const currentSorted = current.toSorted()
  const originalSorted = original.toSorted()
  for (let i = 0; i < currentSorted.length; i++) {
    if (currentSorted[i] !== originalSorted[i]) {
      return true
    }
  }
  return false
}
```

This new approach is more efficient because:
- It avoids the overhead of sorting and joining the arrays when lengths differ
- It avoids consuming memory for the joined strings (especially important for large arrays)
- It avoids mutating the original arrays
- It returns early when a difference is found
