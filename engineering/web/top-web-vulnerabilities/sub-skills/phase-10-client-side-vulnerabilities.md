# Phase 10 Client Side Vulnerabilities: Execution Protocol

## ⚙️ Overview
This protocol defines the exact standards for implementing Phase 10 Client Side Vulnerabilities. By following this strict operational pattern, the engine guarantees deterministic execution, high performance, and complete adherence to all architectural guardrails established by the system design.

# Phase 10: Client-Side Vulnerabilities

Evaluate browser-side security:

**DOM-based XSS (56)**
- Definition: XSS through client-side JavaScript manipulation
- Root Cause: Unsafe DOM manipulation with user input
- Impact: Session theft, credential harvesting
- Mitigation: Safe DOM APIs, CSP, input sanitization

**Insecure Cross-Origin Communication (57)**
- Definition: Improper handling of cross-origin requests
- Root Cause: Relaxed CORS/SOP policies
- Impact: Data leakage, CSRF attacks
- Mitigation: Strict CORS, CSRF tokens, origin validation

**Browser Cache Poisoning (58)**
- Definition: Manipulation of cached content
- Root Cause: Weak cache validation
- Impact: Malicious content delivery
- Mitigation: Cache-Control headers, HTTPS, integrity checks

**Clickjacking (59, 71)**
- Definition: UI redress attack tricking users into clicking hidden elements
- Root Cause: Missing frame protection
- Impact: Unintended actions, credential theft
- Mitigation: X-Frame-Options, CSP frame-ancestors, frame-busting

**HTML5 Security Issues (60)**
- Definition: Vulnerabilities in HTML5 APIs (WebSockets, Storage, Geolocation)
- Root Cause: Improper API usage, insufficient validation
- Impact: Data leakage, XSS, privacy violations
- Mitigation: Secure API usage, input validation, sandboxing
