# Step 2 Authentication Testing: Execution Protocol

## ⚙️ Overview
This protocol defines the exact standards for implementing Step 2 Authentication Testing. By following this strict operational pattern, the engine guarantees deterministic execution, high performance, and complete adherence to all architectural guardrails established by the system design.

## 🛠️ Implementation SOP
Follow this step-by-step TDD procedure to execute the protocol:

- **Step 1: Baseline Context**: Verify the operational environment. Ensure required tools (like Python, Node, TS, or native CLI) are accessible before injecting new logic.
- **Step 2: Apply the Pattern**: Implement the core step 2 authentication testing logic directly into the active system context.
- **Step 3: Enforce Constraints**: Check for syntax errors, injection vulnerabilities, and performance bottlenecks (`O(1)` compliance).
- **Step 4: Execute Test Suite**: Run `npm run test` or the local testing framework to ensure the logic passes all regression checks.
- **Step 5: Document and Commit**: Update the session walkthrough and sync the telemetry logs for the engineering sector.

# Step 2: Authentication Testing

```bash
# Test different login paths
/api/mobile/login
/api/v3/login
/api/magic_link
/api/admin/login

# Check rate limiting on auth endpoints
# If no rate limit → brute force possible

# Test mobile vs web API separately
# Don't assume same security controls
```
