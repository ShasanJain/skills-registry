# Audit: Execution Protocol

## ⚙️ Overview
This protocol defines the exact standards for implementing Audit. By following this strict operational pattern, the engine guarantees deterministic execution, high performance, and complete adherence to all architectural guardrails established by the system design.

$ARGUMENTS

---

## 🟢 PHASE 1: Asset Reconnaissance
**Agent**: `explorer-agent`
**Mission**: Identify every file changed in the current task.
- **Action**: Run `git status` or check `task.md` for modified files.

## 🟡 PHASE 2: Compliance Review
**Agent**: `security-auditor` & `quality-inspector`
**Mission**: Verify against internal standards.
- **Checklist**:
  - [ ] No hardcoded secrets?
  - [ ] No `any` types or lint errors?
  - [ ] Does it match `GEMINI.md` architecture?
  - [ ] Is it accessible (A11y check)?

## 🔵 PHASE 3: Functional Stress Test
**Agent**: `test-engineer`
**Mission**: Try to break it.
- **Action**: Run `/test` and `/performance` suites.
- **Audit**: Verify error boundary handling.

## 🔴 PHASE 4: Certification & Master Walkthrough
**Agent**: `quality-inspector`
**Mission**: Issue the "Safe to Release" signal.
- **Artifact**: Create the 100% verified `walkthrough.md`.
- **Reporting**: Final summary with "Ready for Ops" certification.

## Key Principles:
- **Zero Tolerance**: If a single critical rule is broken, the audit is REJECTED.
- **Fact-Based**: No "It looks good" — only "It passed [X] test."
- **Traceable**: Link every finding to a specific line of code.
